    "\n",
    "As we know from (painful?) experience, Python is powerful because of its ability to leverage `numpy` and `scipy` to implement any statistical model from scratch. We can write the requisite matrix algebra, or the relevant likelihood function, and from there can optimize our model, calculate confidence intervals, and report the output of that model through data frames, lists, or printed tables. Building our own models is great! We get to build a model based on the exact context and assumptions of our problem, and therefore get exactly the model that we wanted. Unfortunately, it takes a LOT of time!\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will provide our first exposure to pre-written statistical modeling in Python. We will be able to use only a couple of lines of code to implement complex and valuable statistical and machine learning models. Because the most costly asset in programming is the time that we spend debugging and writing code (running code is MUCH faster and cheaper than the time spent writing code), we are always looking for ways to avoid writing code that someone else has already written.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each of these libraries is highly optimized to provide performant implementations of models that we use regularly, and allow us to avoid writing these models from scratch unless we need to customize our model for some specific use case! This is great news! You'll never have to think about writing your own linear or logistic regression from scratch again!\n",

    "We have been using regression equations in `statsmodels` a lot without really discussing what is happening behind the scenes. `statsmodels` relies on a library called `patsy` to parse regression equations and prepare our data for regression analysis. While `statsmodels` does a great job of incorporating the `patsy` library for us, this isn't always the case. In fact, it is a really valuable tool in many other contexts (think machine learning or deep learning). \n",
